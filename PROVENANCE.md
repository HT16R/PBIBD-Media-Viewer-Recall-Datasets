These PBIBD teaching datasets were created by the author between January 2024 and January 2025 — before the public release of large-language-model writing assistants.
No generative AI was used in any part of their design, simulation, or documentation. 
All data were simulated by the author using jamovi/R or Python and SPSS for inclusion in the forthcoming textbook Quantitative Media Research: A Global-South-First Textbook (CC-BY 4.0).
